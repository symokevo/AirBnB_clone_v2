# Flask Web Framework

Flask is a popular micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries to function and provides only the bare essentials for building a web application.

## Features

Flask has a number of features that make it a popular choice for building web applications:

- Simple and lightweight: Flask is a simple and lightweight framework that provides the minimum requirements for building a web application.

- Easy to get started: Flask is easy to learn and use, even for beginners.

- Flexible: Flask is highly customizable and allows developers to easily extend its functionality using plugins and extensions.

- Built-in development server: Flask comes with a built-in development server that can be used to test and debug your application.

- Jinja2 templating: Flask uses the Jinja2 templating engine, which allows developers to create HTML templates that can be dynamically populated with data.

- RESTful request dispatching: Flask supports RESTful request dispatching, which is a popular architecture for building web APIs.

## Getting Started

To get started with Flask, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Once you have Python installed, you can install Flask using pip, the Python package manager:

```
pip install Flask
```

Once Flask is installed, you can create a new Flask application by creating a new Python file and importing the Flask module:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
```

This creates a new Flask application instance. You can then define routes for your application using the `@app.route` decorator:

```python
@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

This creates a new route for the root URL of your application that returns a simple greeting.

To run your Flask application, you can use the Flask development server:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

This will start the Flask development server and allow you to access your application in a web browser.

## Conclusion

Flask is a popular and flexible web framework that makes it easy to build web applications in Python. Its simplicity and ease of use make it a great choice for beginners, while its flexibility and extensibility make it suitable for more advanced use cases. With its built-in development server, Jinja2 templating, and support for RESTful request dispatching, Flask provides all the essential tools for building modern web applications.
